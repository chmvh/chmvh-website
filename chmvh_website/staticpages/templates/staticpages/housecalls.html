            Dr. Driehuys will ask you questions to obtain an understanding of
            your pet's personality, behavior, nutrition, activity, and health
            concerns. This initial interview provides time for your pet to
            become acclimated to Dr. Driehuys and allows her to observe your pet
            in his/her home environment.

    <h1 class='text-center'>Housecall FAQs</h1>

    <h3>Why choose CHMVH?</h3>
    <p class='padded-paragraph'>
      CHMVH is a private veterinary practice started by Dr. Sunita Driehuys. Dr.
      Driehuys has many years of experience in small animal veterinary medicine
      in the Triangle area. Her desire to provide high quality care for dogs and
      cats with personal attention for each client and patient led to the
      development of this unique practice in Chapel Hill.
    </p>

    <h3>What services can be provided?</h3>
    <p class='padded-paragraph'>
      Most of the professional services that comprise an outpatient office visit
      in a traditional hospital can be done in the housecall setting. Many of
      the services Dr. Driehuys provides are listed on the
      <a href='{% url "services" %}'>services</a> page of this website.
    </p>

    <h3>What if my pet is anxious?</h3>
    <p class='padded-paragraph'>
      Most pets are more relaxed at home than in a veterinary hospital and
      respond well to home examination. Dr. Driehuys will instruct the owner on
      specific calming techniques for individual patients as needed.
      Occasionally soft cloth muzzles are used to prevent biting. Cats should be
      confined to a bathroom or pet carrier prior to the scheduled appointment.
    </p>

    <h3>What costs can be expected?</h3>
    <p class='padded-paragraph'>
      In general the cost of veterinary care with CHMVH is comparable to the
      cost at traditional veterinary hospitals. Clients appreciate the
      convenience of home appointments, direct access to Dr. Driehuys, and
      thorough examinations and discussions of their pet's needs. Pet health
      insurance will reimburse for CHMVH services. Within the five-mile radius
      shown on the <a href='{% url "hours-and-area" %}'>Hours &amp; Area</a>
      page a travel fee of $37 is assessed for each housecall, regardless of the
      number of pets treated. There is a discounted travel fee for clients within
      Southern Village. Physical examination/consultation is $55-$75 per pet. An
      estimate for all other services will gladly be provided upon request. Prices
      for inventory products are comparable to other hospitals and internet
      providers. CHMVH matches internet prices for flea/tick prevention and
      heartworm prevention.
